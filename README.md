# AtypicalEvents

## Atypical Event Detection
Event prediction code includes feature selection tool (MRMR) [1], and event prediction for positive, negative, and atypical events. I also list the features selected for the hospital and aerospace datasets. Core of MRMR code is created by Shen Yan (shenyan@isi.edu). All other code is written by myself.
